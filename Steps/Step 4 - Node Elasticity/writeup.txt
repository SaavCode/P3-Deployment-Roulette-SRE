Node Elasticity

1. After deploying the bloaty-mcbloatface deployment, some of the pods were in a Pending state.

2. Upon describing one of the pods in Pending state, it was determined that the issue was related to a lack of available resources, and that additional VMs would need to be deployed.

3. It was decided that the most cost-effective option was to scale out (i.e. increase the number of nodes) rather than increase the size of the nodes.
4. To enable node autoscaling, an autoscaling group was created using the cluster_autoscale.yml file, which was added to the bloatware directory.
5. In the console, the number of EC2 instances was verified to be two, and the size of the autoscaling group was noted before making any changes.
6. To fix the failure I increased the size of the autoscaling group, the nodes_max_size was changed to 8 and the nodes_min_size was changed to 1.
7. The infrastructure was updated using terraform apply.
8. The cluster-autoscale was deployed.
9. It was observed that all 16 bloaty-mcbloatface pods were in a Running state.
